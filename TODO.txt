for TODO list see more far below.
also look into TODO list of plone.event and Products.DateRecurringIndex

NOTES from ploneconf2010 open space
===================================

focus on finishing
------------------
* widget (datepicker & recurrencewidget)
* calendar & events portlets
* export ical (maybe also vcal. thet is suggesting to drop support for vcal since it's an really old standard)
* whole day events
* more daterecurringindex tests

* migration work can be done after plip

more
----

* rss support

* calendar views
    monthly view, weekly view, daily view

* hcal microformat

IDEA:
    when deleting an occurence of an recurring event from calendar view,
    deleting should be faked by adding an exclusion date
    google calendar does that thing


timezone issues
---------------
    don't use timezone information at all?
        NO. better not.
    save and display dates in users local timezone
         timezone from request, set by user's browser
    confusing usecase:
        german guy editing events in bristol.
        adapting timezone when editing and displaying
    google calendar: asks if event should be displayed in users local timezone
    or timezone of event location


discussion
----------

* archetype datetime
    see c.z3cform.datetimewidget

* archetype recurrence event widget
    see z3cform recurrence event widget

* subclassing ATEvent possible? yes, should be.

hcal microformat
ical/vcal, drop vcal?



TODO
====

- add <property name="index_naive_time_as_local">True</property> property for
  start and end indexes in catalog.xml as soon as P.DRI has that extra property

OK - update calendar-portlet and move it into plone.app.event
OK - update events-portlet and move it into plone.app.event
- actually test, if calendar and events portlets work with recurrence

- check use of MessageFactory. should message factory be in plone namespace?

- synchronize package with newest ATContentTypes (diff modified with trunk)

- add deprecation warnings for imports from ATContentTypes

- make BBB back-imports of CT, utilities, interfaces, etc in ATContentTypes

- upgrade step to recatalog the start and end indexes

- make calendar widget display (hidden) the timezone

- add a hook to getICal(), getVCal() for retrieving additional data
  from derived event types

- check how much sense start&end metadata columns in catalog.xml make sense.
  they return start&end of first occurence but nothing else.
  --> guess its used by folder_listing displaying start and end time from brain info.

- use plone.testing and plone.app.testing

- think about storing all dates in utc and converting them on display to
  localized time.
  usecase where this won't work: dates going over DST borders. like meeting from
  oktober-november shouldn't change the relative time


OK - clean up recurrence code and only use new rrulestring implementation
OBSOLETE - rename package to plone.app.calendar and create one for plone.calendar (e.g. for RFC2445 definitions)
OK - test for disabled recurrence and None values to store in recurrence field. see how index is behaving


TODO for Plone
==============
- depend on plone.app.event
- include plone.app.event package in configure.zcml
- include plone.app.event in metadata.xml GS profile
- remove catalog index and metadata column and use those in plone.app.event
