- implement RFC2445 event types (event, todo, journal, freebusy) as interfaces which content types may provide
- create adapters which serialize events to iCal format corresponding to their RFC2445 type (event, todo, journal, freebusy)

- rename package to plone.app.calendar and create one for plone.calendar (e.g. for RFC2445 definitions)

- use plone.testing and plone.app.testing

- update calendar-viewlet and move it into plone.app.event

OK - clean up recurrence code and only use new rrulestring implementation

- test for disabled recurrence and None values to store in recurrence field. see how index is behaving

- add a hook to getICal(), getVCal() for retrieving additional data
  from derived event types
