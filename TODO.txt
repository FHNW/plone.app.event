TODO
====

- synchronize package with newest ATContentTypes

- update calendar-viewlet and move it into plone.app.event

- upgrade step to recatalog the start and end indexes

- make calendar widget display (hidden) the timezone

- add a hook to getICal(), getVCal() for retrieving additional data
  from derived event types

- check how much sense start&end metadata columns in catalog.xml make sense.
  they return start&end of first occurence but nothing else.
  --> guess its used by folder_listing displaying start and end time from brain info.

- use plone.testing and plone.app.testing

OK - clean up recurrence code and only use new rrulestring implementation
OBSOLETE - rename package to plone.app.calendar and create one for plone.calendar (e.g. for RFC2445 definitions)
OK - test for disabled recurrence and None values to store in recurrence field. see how index is behaving
